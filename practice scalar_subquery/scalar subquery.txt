/*Create a query that displays all rows and the following columns from the AdventureWorks2019.HumanResources.Employee table: 
BusinessEntityID 
JobTitle 
VacationHours 
Also include a derived column called "MaxVacationHours" that returns the maximum amount of vacation hours for any one employee, in any given row. */

					  from humanresources.employee
					  
Exercise 2:

/*Add a new derived field to your query from Exercise 1, which returns the percent an individual employees' 
vacation hours are, of the maximum vacation hours for any employee. For example, 
the record for the employee with the most vacation hours should have a value of 1.00, or 100%, in this column. */

                      from  humanresources.employee ) as maxvacationhours
					  from humanresources.employee

Refine your output with a criterion in the WHERE clause that filters out any employees whose vacation hours are less then 80% 
of the maximum amount of vacation hours for any one employee. In other words, return only employees who have at least 80% 
as much vacation time as the employee with the most vacation time. 

Hint: The query should return 60 rows.
